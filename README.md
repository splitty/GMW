# GrabMyWaifu
GrabMyWaifu is a simple application that allows for the mass downloading of media by thread on 4Chan.  It currently is set-up to download all of the media of a single thread into a created folder in the name of that thread.  The backbone of this application is JavaFX with the parsing done by jSoup.  Currently, the only availible native installer is for Windows.  GMW is media and not images due to the wide variety of possible formats that it can download.  Wide variety means everything in this case.  Any file linked using a tag that is understood by jSoup can be targeted for download.  With minimal tweaking, GMW can be changed to grab from most any website.  GMW also has the possibility to specify a certain file format, size, resolution, or link structure in the parse.  I'm also looking into an interchangeable preference system using simple .xml files to specify the user's prefered HTML tags and therefore, the website that GMW is able to parse.
